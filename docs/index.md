Welcome to the documentation for **AI Daily Researcher**.

This tool is designed to help researchers and engineers keep up with the accelerating pace of AI advancements without drowning in noise.

## What it does

1.  **Scrapes** the latest papers from ArXiv and blog posts from OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, and HuggingFace.
2.  **Summarizes** content using advanced LLMs (Pass 1).
3.  **Embeds** content for semantic search using a local vector database.
4.  **Presents** a unified, categorized feed for easy consumption.
5.  **Synthesizes** a "Daily Digest" blog post connecting the dots between papers.

## Key Features
